# Blinn-Phong Lighting with OpenGL

This project served as an introduction to OpenGL for me, and helped reinforce many of the concepts I've been learning about computer graphics, including:
- Object Loading (From many different file types, using assimp)
- OpenGL basics
- Shaders and shader programs
- Textures, normals, normal maps
- The Blinn-Phong lighting model
- Basics of CG pipelines
- Camera systems using linear algebra and transformations

## Installation

The visual studio solution and all dependencies are included in this repo; it's a little large but should be easy to get up and running.
TODO:// Compile into a nice executable for easy demonstration

## Resources

- https://learnopengl.com/ - A detailed guide that went over not just OpenGL, but many of the graphics concepts at play
- https://github.com/assimp/assimp - 3D model loading API
- https://github.com/g-truc/glm - 3D math API. Since I implemented many of the math functions in this library in my Computer Graphics course at university, I decided to use a 3rd party math API so I could focus on learning OpenGL
